# Government-Wayback
Unofficial repository storing links to Wayback Machine for federal government pages. This repository does not imply endorsement by any federal government agencies, and all materials are attributed to their respective federal government agencies. The website snapshots we provide links to are stored on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), which is an initiative of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

Note that the "Wayback Links" pages, which contain the contents of the Markdown files (`.md`) in this repository, are rendered by [Docsify-This](https://docsify-this.net/): due to how large they are, they may take ~30 seconds to load.
