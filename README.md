# Government-Wayback
Unofficial repository storing links to Wayback Machine for federal government pages. This repository does not imply endorsement by any federal government agencies, and all materials are attributed to their respective federal government agencies. The website snapshots we provide links to are stored on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), which is an initiative of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

The "Wayback Links" files (`.md` Markdown files) may be too large for GitHub to render, in which case you can use a tool like [Code Beautify Markdown Viewer](https://codebeautify.org/markdown-viewer) to render.
